# Flutter freeCodeCamp Crash Course
This project is done along this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fi2WkznwWbc&t=4190s">freeCodeCamp Tutorial</a>. Aim is to familiarize with Flutter, Firebase, and their usage.

Please note that the tutorial might be a bit out of date. This is a refreshed version of the tutorial's project, and additionally, sign out functionality is implemented. Also, using the sign out, a user can re-enter their profile without a need for a new authentication, if they left the app without signing out. For further details of the application, please refer to the tutorial's link above.

Meanwhile, give a visit to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Freecodecamp">freeCodeCamp</a>'s YouTube channel. They are pretty awesome!
